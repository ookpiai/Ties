## Executive Summary

TIES Together is a comprehensive digital marketplace platform designed to revolutionize how creative professionals connect with venues, organizers, and collaborative opportunities. The platform serves as a unified ecosystem where photographers, models, musicians, videographers, and other creative talent can discover opportunities, manage bookings, collaborate on projects, and build their professional presence. Unlike traditional freelance platforms that focus solely on transactional relationships, TIES Together emphasizes the creative collaboration process, providing sophisticated project management tools alongside marketplace functionality.

The platform addresses a critical gap in the creative industry by combining discovery, booking, payment processing, and project collaboration into a single, cohesive experience. Creative professionals no longer need to juggle multiple platforms for finding work, managing payments, communicating with clients, and coordinating project deliverables. Similarly, venues and event organizers gain access to a curated network of verified creative talent with transparent pricing, verified credentials, and integrated booking workflows that simplify the entire hiring process from initial discovery through final payment.

At its core, TIES Together is built on three fundamental pillars: seamless discovery through advanced search and mapping technology, secure and transparent booking workflows powered by escrow payments, and comprehensive project management through the TIES Studio workspace. These three pillars work in concert to create an end-to-end solution that addresses every stage of the creative professional's workflow, from finding opportunities to delivering completed projects and receiving payment.

## Platform Vision & Market Position

TIES Together positions itself as the definitive platform for creative collaboration in the events, media production, and creative services industries. The platform recognizes that creative work is inherently collaborative and project-based, requiring more sophisticated tools than simple job boards or service marketplaces can provide. By understanding the unique needs of creative professionals who often work on complex, multi-stakeholder projects with evolving requirements, TIES Together delivers a platform that grows with each project rather than simply facilitating one-off transactions.

The platform's vision extends beyond mere marketplace functionality to create a thriving ecosystem where creative professionals can build sustainable careers, venues can maximize their space utilization, and organizers can confidently execute ambitious creative projects. By providing tools for portfolio management, credential verification, project planning, budget tracking, and collaborative workspaces, TIES Together becomes an essential infrastructure layer for the entire creative services industry. The platform aims to elevate the professionalism of creative services by introducing transparency, accountability, and sophisticated tooling typically reserved for traditional corporate industries.

## User Roles & Personas

The TIES Together platform is designed to serve five distinct user types, each with unique needs, workflows, and value propositions. Understanding these user roles is essential to appreciating how the platform creates value across the creative services ecosystem.

### Creative Professionals & Freelancers

Creative professionals represent the primary talent pool on the platform, including photographers, videographers, musicians, makeup artists, stylists, models, dancers, and other creative service providers. These users leverage TIES Together to build their professional presence, showcase their portfolios, discover paid opportunities, and manage their freelance businesses. For these users, the platform serves as both a marketing channel and a business management tool, providing everything from lead generation through payment collection and project delivery.

When creative professionals join TIES Together, they create comprehensive profiles that go far beyond simple resumes. These profiles include curated portfolio galleries featuring their best work, detailed skill listings that help clients find them through search, verified credentials and professional certifications, client reviews and ratings that build trust, and transparent pricing information that sets clear expectations. The platform recognizes that creative professionals are building brands, not just listing services, so every aspect of the profile system is designed to help them present their unique creative voice while maintaining professional credibility.

### Venues & Location Providers

Venues represent a unique user category on TIES Together, encompassing event spaces, studios, galleries, performance halls, outdoor locations, and any physical space that can host creative activities or events. These users join the platform to increase their space utilization, connect with event organizers and creative professionals who need locations, and manage their booking calendars efficiently. The platform's map-based discovery feature, which functions similarly to Airbnb's location search, makes venues highly discoverable to users searching for spaces in specific geographic areas.

Venue profiles on TIES Together include detailed information about the space's capacity, available amenities, technical specifications like lighting and acoustics, available time slots and booking calendar, pricing structures for different usage types, high-quality photography showcasing the space, and verified reviews from previous users. The map-based search interface allows venues to be discovered by users who are literally looking at a specific neighborhood or area, dramatically increasing visibility for well-located spaces. Venues can also specify what types of creative activities they're suitable for, whether that's photography shoots, live music performances, art exhibitions, or corporate events, helping organizers find the perfect match for their needs.

### Event Organizers & Project Managers

Event organizers and project managers are the users who typically initiate creative projects and hire talent through the platform. These users might be corporate event planners, wedding coordinators, marketing agencies executing campaigns, nonprofit organizations hosting fundraisers, or independent producers creating content. For these users, TIES Together serves as both a talent discovery platform and a comprehensive project management suite that helps them coordinate complex creative projects with multiple stakeholders.

Organizers use the platform to discover and vet creative talent through searchable profiles and portfolios, post detailed job listings that attract qualified applicants, manage booking requests and negotiate terms, coordinate projects through TIES Studio workspaces, track budgets and manage payments through escrow, and communicate with their entire creative team in one centralized location. The platform's project management capabilities are particularly valuable for organizers managing complex events or productions that require coordinating photographers, videographers, musicians, stylists, and venue providers simultaneously. Rather than juggling email threads, separate payment platforms, and disconnected communication tools, organizers can manage their entire project within the TIES Together ecosystem.

### Equipment Vendors & Service Providers

Vendors represent a specialized user category that provides equipment rentals, technical services, catering, transportation, and other supporting services that creative projects require. These users might include lighting and camera equipment rental companies, audio-visual technical support providers, catering services for events, transportation and logistics companies, or specialized creative services like photo retouching or video editing. Vendors on TIES Together benefit from being discoverable within the same ecosystem where projects are being planned, allowing them to be seamlessly integrated into project budgets and workflows.

Vendor profiles highlight their service offerings, equipment inventory and specifications, pricing structures and rental terms, availability calendars, technical expertise and certifications, and reviews from previous clients. The platform's project workspace allows vendors to be tagged and brought into specific projects, where they can access project details, coordinate logistics with other team members, and track their deliverables. This integration ensures that vendors aren't afterthoughts in project planning but are properly resourced and coordinated from the project's inception.

### Collectives & Creative Agencies

Collectives represent groups of creative professionals who work together under a shared brand, whether that's a photography collective, a creative agency, a production company, or an artist management group. These users leverage TIES Together to present a unified brand while showcasing their individual team members' talents, manage their collective's bookings and projects, coordinate internal team assignments and workloads, and scale their business by taking on larger, more complex projects that require multiple specialists.

Collective accounts on the platform function as umbrella profiles that showcase the group's overall brand, portfolio, and capabilities while also maintaining individual member profiles. This structure allows clients to book the collective as a whole or request specific team members for projects. Collectives benefit from TIES Studio's collaboration features, which help them coordinate internal workflows, assign tasks to team members, track project progress, and manage client deliverables. The platform essentially provides collectives with the infrastructure to operate as professional creative agencies without building custom internal systems.

## User Journey: From Registration to Project Completion

Understanding how users move through the TIES Together platform provides insight into the comprehensive nature of the user experience. The platform is designed to support users through every stage of their creative professional journey, from initial registration through ongoing project work and career development.

### Registration & Onboarding Experience

The user's journey with TIES Together begins with a streamlined yet comprehensive onboarding process designed to quickly get users to value while collecting the information necessary to create meaningful connections. The platform supports multiple registration methods to reduce friction, including traditional email and password registration, Google OAuth for instant signup using existing Google accounts, Facebook and Apple social authentication options, and eventual support for other major identity providers. This flexibility ensures that users can begin their journey in seconds without creating yet another set of credentials to remember.

Once authentication is complete, new users enter a guided onboarding flow that adapts based on their selected role. The system first asks users to identify their primary role from the five user types, then presents role-specific questions that gather relevant information. For creative professionals, this includes their primary creative discipline, years of experience, key skills and specializations, geographic location and willingness to travel, and rate structure preferences. For venues, the system collects information about space capacity, location and address for map placement, available amenities and technical capabilities, and typical usage scenarios and pricing. For organizers, the focus is on the types of projects they typically manage, their organization type and industry, and their typical project scale and budget ranges.

The onboarding process is designed to be progressive, meaning users don't need to complete every field before accessing the platform. Instead, the system tracks profile completion percentage and gently encourages users to add more information over time by highlighting how additional details improve their visibility in search results, increase their credibility with potential clients, and unlock advanced features like TIES Studio access. This approach balances the need to collect comprehensive information with the reality that users want to explore the platform before committing significant time to profile creation.

### Discovery & Search Experience

Once onboarded, users can immediately begin discovering opportunities, talent, or venues depending on their role. The discovery experience on TIES Together is powered by multiple complementary search and browsing mechanisms that help users find exactly what they need while also enabling serendipitous discovery of opportunities they hadn't considered.

The primary search interface provides a powerful text-based search that queries across user profiles, including names, bios, skills, portfolio descriptions, and location information. The search engine employs intelligent ranking that prioritizes verified users, active Pro subscribers, users with complete profiles and strong review ratings, and those with recent activity. Search results can be refined through comprehensive filters that narrow results by user role, geographic location, specific skills or specializations, verification status, availability, and price range. The search interface updates results in real-time as users adjust filters, providing immediate feedback and helping users quickly narrow down to their ideal matches.

For venue discovery specifically, TIES Together introduces a revolutionary map-based search interface inspired by Airbnb's location-centric design. When users are searching for venues, they can switch to map view where they see an interactive map with venue locations marked as pins. This map interface allows users to pan and zoom to explore specific neighborhoods or areas, see multiple venues in proximity to gauge options, click on venue pins to see quick preview cards with photos and key details, and use a "Search this area" button that updates results as they move the map. This geographic discovery is transformative for event planners and organizers who have specific location requirements, whether they need a venue near a particular address, want to explore options in a trending neighborhood, or are looking for spaces clustered together for multi-location events.

The map-based search is powered by Mapbox's geographic APIs, which provide geocoding to convert venue addresses into precise map coordinates, interactive map rendering optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, clustering algorithms that group nearby venues when zoomed out to prevent visual clutter, and real-time updates as users interact with the map. Users can overlay filters on the map view, such as showing only venues with capacity for more than 200 people, displaying only venues available on specific dates, or highlighting venues within a certain price range. This combination of geographic and attribute-based filtering creates an incredibly efficient venue discovery experience.

Beyond search and map interfaces, TIES Together provides curated discovery feeds that help users find opportunities through browsing rather than explicit searching. The discovery feed presents a personalized stream of content including new users who match the viewer's typical search patterns, recently posted job opportunities relevant to the user's skills, featured portfolios from highly rated creative professionals, and trending projects or events in the user's geographic area. This feed-based discovery helps users stay engaged with the platform even when they're not actively seeking specific opportunities, building awareness of the broader creative community and potentially surfacing unexpected collaboration opportunities.

### Booking & Hiring Workflow

When users discover a creative professional or venue they want to work with, the booking workflow begins. This workflow is designed to formalize the working relationship, establish clear terms, and provide payment security for both parties through escrow mechanisms. The booking system is one of TIES Together's core value propositions, as it transforms informal creative relationships into professional, legally clear engagements with financial protection.

The booking process begins when a client (typically an organizer or venue) views a creative professional's profile and decides to initiate a booking. The platform provides a structured booking request form that captures essential information including the specific service or role being requested, project date and time range, location where the work will take place, detailed description of what's expected, proposed budget, and any special requirements or questions. This structured approach ensures that both parties have clarity about the engagement from the outset, reducing misunderstandings that can derail creative projects.

Once submitted, the booking request appears in the creative professional's dashboard under pending requests. The professional can review all details, ask clarifying questions through the platform's messaging system, and ultimately accept or decline the request. If accepted, the booking moves to the payment phase where TIES Together's integration with Stripe Connect creates a secure escrow arrangement. The client is prompted to pay the agreed-upon amount, which is processed through Stripe's payment infrastructure with full PCI compliance and fraud protection. Critically, these funds are held in escrow rather than immediately transferred to the creative professional, protecting the client's investment while assuring the professional that funds are secured.

During the escrow period, both parties can see the booking status in their respective dashboards. The status progresses through clearly defined stages: pending acceptance from the creative professional, payment pending from the client, payment secured in escrow with booking confirmed, project in progress during the actual work period, and finally completion pending where both parties confirm the work is complete. This status progression provides transparency and helps both parties understand exactly where they are in the process at any given time.

Upon project completion, both the client and creative professional mark the work as complete. Once both parties confirm completion, the escrow funds are released to the creative professional's connected Stripe account, minus the platform commission. The commission structure is tiered based on the creative professional's subscription level: free users pay a ten percent commission while Pro subscribers enjoy a reduced eight percent commission, incentivizing professionals to upgrade as they do more business through the platform. The entire payment process, from escrow creation through fund release, is handled automatically through Stripe's APIs, meaning TIES Together never directly handles sensitive payment information and both parties benefit from Stripe's robust security and compliance infrastructure.

If issues arise during a booking, the platform provides dispute resolution mechanisms. Either party can flag a booking as problematic, which pauses automatic fund release and notifies the platform's support team. For disputes involving payment, the escrow system ensures funds remain secure until resolution, whether that's partial payment reflecting partial completion, full refund if work wasn't delivered, or mediated resolution based on evidence from both parties. This dispute handling creates accountability that benefits professional users while protecting clients from poor service.

### Communication & Messaging

Throughout the booking process and beyond, users need to communicate about project details, coordinate logistics, and build professional relationships. TIES Together provides a comprehensive messaging system that keeps all project-related communication in one place, ensuring that important details aren't lost in personal email accounts or scattered across multiple platforms.

The messaging system provides one-to-one direct messaging between any two users on the platform, threaded conversations that maintain context across long discussions, real-time message delivery powered by Supabase's Realtime API ensuring instant communication, unread message indicators and counts so users never miss important messages, and message search functionality to find past conversations and shared information. Messages are organized by conversation thread, with each thread showing the other user's profile picture, name, and the most recent message preview, making it easy to navigate between multiple ongoing conversations.

When users receive new messages while not actively using the platform, they're notified through multiple channels to ensure timely responses. Email notifications powered by SendGrid alert users about new messages with message previews and direct links to respond in the platform. Push notifications appear on their devices if they've enabled browser notifications. Unread message badges appear throughout the platform interface, drawing attention to pending communications. This multi-channel notification approach ensures that important project communications don't go unnoticed, which is critical for time-sensitive creative projects.

The messaging system integrates deeply with other platform features, creating contextual communication that enhances collaboration. When viewing a booking, users can message the other party directly from the booking page, with the conversation automatically tagged with booking context. In TIES Studio workspaces, project-specific messaging keeps all team communication organized within the project rather than scattered across personal message threads. Venue inquiry messages can reference specific dates and availability, with the system automatically including relevant details. This contextual integration means users don't need to manually explain which project or booking they're discussing – the system provides that context automatically.

### Profile & Portfolio Management

For creative professionals, their TIES Together profile is simultaneously their resume, their portfolio, their marketing material, and their business card. The platform provides sophisticated profile management tools that help creatives present themselves professionally while showcasing their unique artistic voice and capabilities.

The profile system is organized into multiple sections that collectively tell the story of the creative professional's experience, capabilities, and style. The header section provides immediate impact with a large cover image that can showcase the professional's work or brand, a profile avatar that appears throughout the platform, the user's display name and tagline, their primary role and specializations, their location and willingness to travel for work, and quick indicators of verification status, reviews, and completed projects. This header creates the crucial first impression when potential clients discover the profile.

The portfolio section is the heart of the creative professional's profile, where they curate their best work to demonstrate their capabilities and style. Portfolio items can include high-resolution photographs organized in galleries, embedded videos with platform-native playback, audio samples for musicians and sound designers, PDF documents for designers or producers to share lookbooks and creative decks, and detailed case studies that tell the story behind featured projects. Each portfolio item can be tagged with relevant skills, project types, and styles, helping them appear in filtered searches. Creative professionals can designate certain items as "featured" which gives them prominence at the top of their portfolio, allowing them to control which work makes the strongest first impression.

The platform leverages Cloudinary's media optimization APIs to ensure portfolio content loads quickly without sacrificing quality. Uploaded images are automatically converted to modern formats like WebP for browsers that support them, resized to multiple responsive versions for different screen sizes, optimized for file size while maintaining visual quality, and delivered through a content delivery network for fast loading globally. Videos are automatically transcoded to web-optimized formats and served with adaptive bitrate streaming for smooth playback. These optimizations happen automatically behind the scenes, ensuring creative professionals' work always presents beautifully without requiring technical expertise in web optimization.

Beyond portfolios, profiles include comprehensive information about skills and specializations with each skill tagged for searchability, experience level indicators and years in the field, education, certifications, and professional training, equipment and technical capabilities, and work preferences regarding project types, remote vs. on-location work, and travel willingness. The profile also displays social proof through client reviews and ratings, verified credentials and background checks, completed project count and platform tenure, and endorsements from other users in the creative community. This combination of portfolio, credentials, and social proof creates a comprehensive picture that helps clients make confident hiring decisions.

Users maintain control over their profile visibility and privacy through granular settings. Professionals can choose whether their profile appears in public search results or is only visible to logged-in users, hide specific portfolio items from public view while keeping them available for private sharing, control what information appears in search results versus full profile views, and temporarily mark themselves as unavailable while maintaining their profile presence. This flexibility allows users to maintain their presence on the platform while managing their capacity and controlling their professional brand.

### TIES Studio: Project Management & Collaboration

While discovery, booking, and profiles address the marketplace and networking aspects of TIES Together, TIES Studio represents the platform's unique value proposition for managing the actual work of creative projects. TIES Studio is a comprehensive project management workspace designed specifically for creative collaboration, providing tools that help teams plan, coordinate, execute, and deliver complex creative projects with multiple stakeholders and evolving requirements.

TIES Studio becomes accessible when an organizer or creative professional creates a project. Projects are containers that hold all information, communication, files, and tasks related to a specific creative engagement. Whether it's a wedding, a corporate event, a photo shoot, a music video production, or an art exhibition, each project gets its own dedicated workspace where everyone involved can collaborate.

When creating a project, the initiator provides foundational information including the project title and description, project type classification helping with organization and templates, start and end dates establishing the timeline, primary location where the work takes place, total budget and how funds will be allocated, and privacy settings determining who can view and access the project. Once created, the project workspace becomes the central hub for all project-related activity, replacing scattered email threads, separate document storage, and disconnected task lists with a unified collaboration environment.

The collaborator management system allows project owners to invite team members into the project workspace with specific permission levels. Project administrators have full control including adding and removing team members, modifying budget and timeline, and deleting the project entirely. Editors can create and assign tasks, upload files, participate in discussions, and mark work complete. Viewers can see project details and progress but cannot make changes, which is perfect for clients or stakeholders who need visibility without editing access. This role-based access control ensures everyone has appropriate access while protecting sensitive project information.

Within each project workspace, the task management system helps teams organize and track the many moving pieces of creative projects. Tasks can be created to represent any work item that needs completion, from "scout venue locations" to "edit final video" to "confirm catering headcount." Each task includes a descriptive title and detailed description, an assigned team member responsible for completion, priority level indicating urgency (low, medium, high), due date for deadline tracking, and current status (to-do, in progress, or completed). Tasks can be viewed in multiple formats including a kanban board organized by status columns for visual workflow management, a timeline Gantt chart showing task dependencies and scheduling, a simple list view filtered and sorted by various attributes, and a calendar view showing when tasks are due. This flexibility allows teams to visualize their work in whatever format best matches their planning style.

The budget tracking tools in TIES Studio help project managers maintain financial oversight throughout the project lifecycle. The budget can be broken down into line items representing different expense categories: talent fees for creative professionals, venue rental costs, equipment and vendor expenses, post-production and editing work, travel and logistics costs, and contingency buffers for unexpected expenses. As expenses are incurred or booked through the platform, they're automatically tracked against budget line items, showing spending progress. The budget dashboard displays total allocated budget, funds already committed through platform bookings, actual expenditures versus estimates, and remaining budget available. This real-time financial visibility helps project managers make informed decisions about resource allocation and prevents budget overruns that plague many creative projects.

File management in TIES Studio provides version-controlled, organized storage for all project-related assets. Team members can upload files directly to the project workspace, where they're organized in folders and tagged for easy retrieval. The system tracks file versions, allowing teams to see how deliverables evolve over time and revert to previous versions if needed. Files can be previewed directly in the browser without downloading, with support for images, videos, PDFs, and common document formats. Comments can be added to specific files, creating threaded discussions about particular assets without cluttering general project communication. This centralized file management ensures that everyone is always working with the latest versions and that nothing gets lost in email attachments or personal storage.

Project-specific messaging keeps all team communication organized and contextual within TIES Studio. Rather than mixing project discussion with personal conversations in the general messaging system, project messaging creates a dedicated communication space just for the project team. All project collaborators can participate in these discussions, which are threaded and searchable. The system supports rich media in messages, allowing teams to share quick snapshots, reference uploaded files, and even embed links to specific tasks they're discussing. This integrated communication means teams don't need to constantly explain context – the conversation is already happening within the project where all relevant information is accessible.

For projects that need client visibility without full editing access, TIES Studio offers a client dashboard view. This specialized interface shows clients project progress, upcoming milestones, budget status, and key deliverables without overwhelming them with task-level details or giving them access to internal team discussions. Clients can view the project timeline, see overall completion percentage, review and approve deliverables, and communicate with the project manager through designated channels. This client-facing view helps maintain professional boundaries while keeping stakeholders informed and engaged.

TIES Studio also provides project templates that help users quickly set up common project types with pre-configured tasks, budget categories, and workflows. Templates are available for weddings and celebrations, corporate events and conferences, photography and video shoots, music performances and recordings, art exhibitions and installations, and marketing campaigns and content creation. When creating a project from a template, users get a head start with logical task breakdowns and budget structures that can be customized for their specific needs, dramatically reducing the time spent on project setup and helping less experienced users leverage best practices.

## Subscription Tiers & Monetization

TIES Together operates on a freemium business model that allows users to access core marketplace functionality for free while offering premium subscriptions that provide enhanced features, lower transaction fees, and professional tools for power users. This approach ensures the platform is accessible to emerging creatives while generating sustainable revenue from established professionals and organizations who derive significant value from the platform.

### TIES Free: Entry-Level Access

The free tier provides all essential functionality needed to participate in the TIES Together marketplace. Free users can create comprehensive profiles with unlimited portfolio items, showcase their skills and experience, appear in search results and map-based venue discovery, apply for posted job opportunities, receive and respond to booking requests, communicate through the platform messaging system, and access basic project management in TIES Studio with limitations on the number of active projects. The free tier's primary limitation is a ten percent commission on all completed bookings processed through the platform, which is higher than the discounted rate available to Pro subscribers.

This free tier serves multiple strategic purposes for the platform. It lowers the barrier to entry for emerging creatives who are building their client base and may not be able to justify subscription costs early in their careers. It allows venues and organizers to try the platform without financial commitment before deciding if premium features are worthwhile. It grows the overall supply of talent on the marketplace, which improves the client experience and network effects. And it creates a natural upgrade path as users start doing significant business through the platform and realize the cost savings and enhanced features of paid subscriptions justify the investment.

### TIES Pro: Professional Enhancement

TIES Pro is positioned at fifteen dollars per month and targets creative professionals and venues who are actively using the platform for business and want to maximize their return on investment. The most immediate value proposition of Pro is the reduced commission rate: Pro subscribers pay only eight percent commission on bookings compared to ten percent for free users. For a creative professional doing even a few thousand dollars of bookings per month through the platform, this two percent reduction effectively pays for the subscription while still saving money.

Beyond commission savings, Pro subscribers receive tangible benefits that enhance their marketplace presence and business capabilities. Their profiles receive boosted placement in search results, appearing higher than free users with similar qualifications when clients are browsing for talent. They gain access to detailed analytics about their profile performance, including view counts, search appearances, inquiry rates, and conversion metrics that help them optimize their presence. Pro users can send priority direct messages that are flagged as coming from verified Pro users, potentially increasing response rates from clients. They receive early notification of newly posted job opportunities, giving them first access to apply for desirable bookings. And they can feature up to five portfolio projects with special highlighting in their profile, versus three for free users.

For venues specifically, Pro membership includes prominent placement on the map-based search interface with distinctive markers that stand out, the ability to showcase up to twenty high-quality photos of their space versus ten for free users, advanced booking calendar management with availability rules and automated responses, and detailed analytics about search visibility, inquiry rates, and booking conversion. These features help venues maximize their space utilization by ensuring they're visible to the right audiences at the right times.

The Pro tier's pricing and feature set are carefully calibrated to provide clear ROI for users doing regular business through the platform while remaining affordable for solo creative professionals and small venue operators. The subscription pays for itself through commission savings alone, making it an easy decision for active users, while the enhanced features provide additional value that reinforces the subscription's worth.

### Studio Pro: Team Collaboration & Advanced Project Management

Studio Pro, priced at thirty dollars per month, targets power users who regularly manage complex creative projects with multiple team members, substantial budgets, and sophisticated coordination requirements. This tier is designed for creative agencies, event production companies, collectives managing numerous projects, venues hosting multiple events simultaneously, and established creative professionals who frequently coordinate with teams of subcontractors and vendors.

The defining feature of Studio Pro is unlimited project workspaces in TIES Studio, removing the free tier's limitation of three active projects at a time. For organizations managing dozens of simultaneous productions or events, this unlimited access is essential and justifies the subscription cost on its own. Studio Pro projects also gain access to advanced features not available to free or Pro users, including project templates that can be created, saved, and reused for common project types, budget templates with pre-configured line items for different project categories, automated task creation based on project timelines and templates, advanced team collaboration tools including project roles and granular permissions, budget forecasting and variance reporting that compares planned versus actual spending, resource management tools to track team member capacity across multiple projects, and integration with Google Calendar for automatic schedule synchronization.

Studio Pro subscribers also receive all the benefits of TIES Pro, including the eight percent commission rate and boosted profile placement, along with additional enhancements specific to project management needs. They gain access to dedicated account support with priority response times, advanced reporting and analytics across all their projects, custom branding options for client-facing project dashboards, and the ability to create team accounts where multiple users within an organization can collaborate under a single subscription.

The thirty-dollar price point for Studio Pro reflects the sophisticated business needs this tier serves. Organizations managing complex projects with substantial budgets can easily justify the cost when considering the efficiency gains from centralized project management, the commission savings on larger booking volumes, and the professional presentation enabled by advanced features. The tier effectively positions TIES Together as professional infrastructure for established creative businesses, not just a marketplace for individual transactions.

## Payment Processing & Financial Security

Financial transactions are at the heart of any marketplace, and TIES Together's payment infrastructure is designed to provide security, transparency, and efficiency for all parties. The platform's integration with Stripe Connect provides enterprise-grade payment processing without requiring TIES Together to directly handle sensitive financial information, ensuring PCI compliance and robust fraud protection while maintaining a seamless user experience.

### Payment Flow Architecture

The payment architecture begins when creative professionals and venues first join the platform. To receive payments through TIES Together, users must complete Stripe Connect onboarding, which creates a connected Stripe account linked to their platform profile. This onboarding process, handled entirely through Stripe's secure infrastructure, collects necessary information including banking details for receiving payouts, tax information required for compliance and reporting, identity verification to prevent fraud, and business information for users operating as registered entities. This information goes directly to Stripe rather than being stored by TIES Together, ensuring sensitive financial data is handled by payment industry experts with appropriate security infrastructure.

When a booking is created and accepted, the payment flow begins. The client is presented with Stripe Checkout, a secure payment interface that accepts all major credit and debit cards, supports digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, handles 3D Secure authentication for fraud prevention, and provides immediate payment confirmation. The client's payment information is tokenized by Stripe, meaning TIES Together never sees or stores actual card numbers. The funds are processed immediately and moved into platform escrow, which is technically held in the platform's Stripe Connect account with clear accounting of which funds belong to which booking.

During the escrow period, funds are secured but not yet transferred to the creative professional. Both parties can see the escrow status in their booking dashboards, providing transparency about fund availability. The escrow period continues through the project's active phase, protecting both the client's investment and assuring the creative professional that funds are secured. This arrangement prevents common freelance payment issues where clients delay payment indefinitely after work is delivered or creative professionals receive payment but fail to deliver promised work.

When both parties mark the booking as complete, the escrow release process begins automatically. The system calculates the platform commission based on the creative professional's subscription tier (eight percent for Pro users, ten percent for free users), deducts the commission from the total booking amount, and initiates a Stripe transfer of the remaining funds to the creative professional's connected account. These transfers typically complete within two business days, with timing depending on the banking partner's processing schedule. The creative professional receives email notification when funds are transferred, with detailed information about the original booking amount, commission deducted, and net payout received.

### Subscription Billing Management

For users subscribing to TIES Pro or Studio Pro, the platform uses Stripe Checkout and Stripe Billing APIs to handle recurring subscription charges. When users upgrade to a paid subscription tier, they're directed to Stripe Checkout where they securely enter payment information and authorize recurring charges. Stripe then automatically processes subscription payments on the monthly billing cycle, retrying failed payments with exponential backoff if a card is declined, sending payment receipts automatically, and providing detailed invoices accessible through the user's billing dashboard.

Users can manage their subscriptions through the platform's billing interface, which provides clear information about their current subscription tier and renewal date, upcoming charges and billing history, payment method on file with options to update, and straightforward cancellation with prorated refunds for unused time. The subscription management system integrates with Stripe webhooks to handle real-time events: when a subscription payment succeeds, the user's account is updated with the new billing period; when a payment fails, the user receives notification and grace period before feature access is affected; when a user cancels, their subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period before reverting to the free tier.

### Security & Compliance

The entire payment infrastructure is designed around security and regulatory compliance best practices. By leveraging Stripe Connect, TIES Together inherits Stripe's PCI DSS Level 1 certification, the highest level of payment industry security compliance. All payment data is encrypted in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols. Stripe's fraud detection algorithms analyze every transaction for suspicious patterns and can block high-risk payments before they're processed. The platform implements strong customer authentication as required by regulations like PSD2 in Europe, using 3D Secure when necessary.

For tax compliance, Stripe automatically generates 1099-K tax forms for creative professionals who exceed reporting thresholds in the United States, provides detailed transaction records that users can export for tax preparation, and can be configured to calculate and collect sales tax or VAT where applicable. International payments are supported with automatic currency conversion, allowing clients in one country to book creative professionals in another with transparent foreign exchange rates and no hidden fees.

## Technology Stack & API Integration Strategy

TIES Together is architected as a modern web application leveraging best-in-class APIs and services to provide robust functionality without reinventing complex infrastructure. This API-first approach accelerates development, improves reliability through proven services, reduces ongoing maintenance burden, and allows the platform to scale efficiently as user growth demands increased capacity.

### Frontend Architecture

The user-facing application is built with React 19, providing a responsive, interactive interface that works seamlessly across desktop browsers, tablets, and mobile devices. The frontend uses Vite as its build tool for fast development iteration and optimized production builds. TypeScript provides type safety for critical code paths while allowing JavaScript flexibility where appropriate. TailwindCSS delivers utility-first styling that enables rapid UI development while maintaining visual consistency, with a custom theme configured to match the platform's brand identity.

The component architecture leverages shadcn/ui, a curated collection of accessible, customizable UI components built on Radix UI primitives. This provides buttons, forms, dialogs, dropdowns, and other interface elements with sophisticated accessibility features including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and focus management without requiring custom implementation. The component library enables rapid feature development while ensuring the platform is usable by people with disabilities, which is both an ethical imperative and a legal requirement in many jurisdictions.

For state management and data fetching, the frontend uses TanStack Query (formerly React Query) which provides intelligent caching, automatic background refetching, optimistic updates, and request deduplication. When users navigate through the application, previously fetched data is instantly available from cache while fresh data is fetched in the background, creating a snappy user experience even on slower network connections. Authentication state is managed through Supabase's client SDK, which handles session management, token refresh, and protected route redirects automatically.

### Authentication & User Management

User authentication is powered by Supabase Auth, which provides secure authentication infrastructure with support for multiple sign-in methods. Email and password authentication uses secure hashing algorithms and protects against common attacks like brute force and credential stuffing. OAuth integration with Google, Facebook, and Apple allows users to sign in with existing accounts, leveraging those providers' identity verification and reducing friction. Magic link authentication enables passwordless login via email for users who prefer not to manage passwords. The authentication system integrates seamlessly with the database layer, automatically creating user records and managing session tokens.

Supabase Auth handles complex security concerns including password reset flows with time-limited tokens, email verification to confirm account ownership, JWT token generation and validation for API authentication, session management with automatic token refresh, and protection against common vulnerabilities like CSRF and session hijacking. These features are provided out-of-the-box, allowing TIES Together to offer enterprise-grade authentication security without building custom authentication infrastructure.

### Database & Storage

The platform's primary database is PostgreSQL hosted through Supabase, providing a robust relational database with strong consistency guarantees, complex query capabilities, and horizontal scaling options as data grows. The database schema includes tables for user profiles, portfolio items, bookings, messages, projects, tasks, files, and other core entities, with carefully designed relationships and indexes to ensure query performance at scale.

Supabase provides row-level security (RLS) policies that enforce access control at the database level. These policies ensure users can only read and modify data they have permission to access, with rules encoded in SQL that are enforced by the database itself rather than relying solely on application-layer checks. This defense-in-depth approach prevents security vulnerabilities where application code might accidentally expose data it shouldn't.

For file storage, Supabase Storage provides S3-compatible object storage for user-uploaded content including profile avatars, portfolio images and videos, project files, and other media. Files are organized in buckets with access policies, served through a CDN for fast global delivery, and support resumable uploads for large files. The storage system integrates with Cloudinary for automatic image optimization, meaning images uploaded by users are automatically resized to multiple responsive sizes, converted to modern formats like WebP for supporting browsers, compressed for optimal file size without visible quality loss, and cached globally for fast loading anywhere in the world.

### Maps & Geolocation

The venue map-based search feature is powered by Mapbox, providing interactive maps with customizable styling, smooth pan and zoom interactions, and rich geographic features. The Mapbox GL JS library renders vector maps that are crisp on high-resolution displays and support dynamic styling and filtering. The Geocoding API converts venue addresses entered by users into precise latitude and longitude coordinates that can be displayed on the map, handles address autocomplete for improved data entry accuracy, and supports reverse geocoding to convert coordinates back into human-readable addresses.

When users search for venues in map view, the system queries the database for venues with coordinates within the visible map bounds, clusters nearby venues when zoomed out to prevent marker overlap, and renders custom markers with venue photos and key details. As users pan or zoom the map, a "Search this area" button allows them to refresh results for the new visible area. Clicking a marker opens a popup with venue preview information and links to the full profile. This map-based discovery provides an intuitive, geographic way to find venues that text-based search alone cannot match.

### Payment Processing

All payment processing leverages Stripe's comprehensive payment APIs. Stripe Connect provides marketplace payment infrastructure where creative professionals and venues create connected accounts that can receive transfers from the platform. Stripe Payment Intents API handles booking payments with support for numerous payment methods, automatic 3D Secure authentication, and sophisticated fraud detection. Stripe Checkout provides a secure, hosted payment interface that reduces PCI compliance scope for the platform while offering optimized conversion and support for digital wallets. Stripe Transfers API automatically splits payments between the platform (commission) and creative professionals (payout) when escrow funds are released. Stripe Billing handles recurring subscription charges for Pro and Studio Pro tiers with automatic retry logic and flexible pricing models.

Stripe webhooks provide real-time notifications about payment events, allowing the platform to update booking statuses when payments succeed or fail, notify users about failed subscription payments requiring updated payment information, track chargebacks and disputes, and maintain synchronized state between Stripe and the platform database. This webhook integration ensures the platform's financial data remains accurate and users are promptly informed about payment-related events.

### Communication & Notifications

Transactional email is powered by SendGrid, which provides reliable email delivery, pre-built templates for common email types, delivery analytics showing open and click rates, and tools for managing suppression lists and bounce handling. The platform sends various transactional emails including booking confirmations, payment receipts, new message notifications, subscription renewal reminders, and account verification emails. These emails are templated with consistent branding and include personalized details about the specific event triggering the email.

Real-time messaging within the platform leverages Supabase Realtime, which provides WebSocket connections that push new messages to users instantly without requiring page refresh or polling. When a user sends a message, it's inserted into the database and simultaneously broadcast to any connected clients viewing that conversation. This creates an instant messaging experience comparable to dedicated chat applications. The Realtime system also powers presence features showing when users are online and typing indicators within conversations.

### Analytics & Monitoring

Google Analytics 4 tracks user behavior throughout the platform, providing insights into user acquisition sources, conversion funnels showing where users drop off during onboarding or booking flows, feature usage patterns indicating which platform capabilities are most valuable, and cohort retention analysis measuring long-term engagement. These analytics inform product development priorities by revealing what features users value and where the experience needs improvement.

Sentry provides error tracking and performance monitoring, automatically capturing JavaScript errors that occur in users' browsers, server-side errors from the backend API, performance metrics showing slow page loads or API calls, and user session replay to understand the context around errors. When errors are detected, developers receive immediate alerts with detailed stack traces and context, allowing rapid diagnosis and fixes. Performance monitoring helps identify bottlenecks as the platform scales, ensuring the user experience remains fast even as data volumes and concurrent users increase.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

TIES Together is designed for cloud-native deployment with horizontal scalability, high availability, and global performance. The platform leverages managed services wherever possible to minimize operational overhead and maximize reliability.

### Hosting & Computing

The React frontend is deployed as static assets to Vercel or Netlify, both of which provide global CDN distribution, automatic SSL certificates, instant rollback capabilities, preview deployments for every pull request, and zero-configuration scaling to handle traffic spikes. These platforms serve the frontend assets from edge locations worldwide, ensuring fast page loads regardless of user location. The build process compiles React components into optimized JavaScript bundles with code splitting to minimize initial load time.

The Flask backend API can be deployed either as a traditional long-running server on platforms like Render or Railway, or as serverless functions on platforms like Vercel Serverless Functions or AWS Lambda. The serverless approach provides automatic scaling where compute capacity expands and contracts with demand, pay-per-invocation pricing that's cost-effective for varying load, and zero-server management overhead. For production deployment at scale, a container-based approach using Docker on AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run provides more control over the runtime environment while maintaining automatic scaling capabilities.

### Database Infrastructure

Supabase provides fully managed PostgreSQL databases with automatic backups running hourly with point-in-time recovery, connection pooling to efficiently handle many concurrent users, read replicas for distributing query load, and vertical scaling options to increase database capacity as data grows. The database is configured with appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns, optimized query plans for complex searches, and materialized views for expensive aggregations. As the platform grows beyond the capacity of a single database instance, Supabase supports horizontal scaling through PostgreSQL extensions like Citus that shard data across multiple nodes.

### File Storage & CDN

User-uploaded files stored in Supabase Storage are automatically replicated across multiple availability zones for durability and distributed through Cloudflare's CDN for low-latency access worldwide. Cloudinary sits in front of image assets, providing on-the-fly transformations where the same source image can be delivered at different sizes or formats based on the requesting device, automatic quality optimization that reduces file size while maintaining perceived quality, and aggressive caching to minimize bandwidth costs. Videos can be processed through Cloudinary's video service or Mux for adaptive bitrate streaming that adjusts quality based on viewer bandwidth.

### Security Infrastructure

Cloudflare provides a web application firewall (WAF) that protects against common attacks including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and DDoS attacks. Rate limiting prevents abuse by restricting how many requests a user or IP address can make within a time window, protecting against credential stuffing attacks on login and API abuse. Bot management distinguishes legitimate users from automated scrapers or attack bots. SSL/TLS encryption is enforced for all connections between users and the platform, with automatic certificate management and modern cipher suite configuration.

### Monitoring & Observability

Production infrastructure is monitored through multiple layers to ensure reliability and performance. Uptime monitoring through services like UptimeRobot or Better Uptime continuously checks that the platform is accessible and responding correctly, alerting on-call engineers immediately if downtime is detected. Application performance monitoring through Sentry tracks error rates, slow API responses, and database query performance. Infrastructure monitoring tracks server CPU, memory, and disk usage, database connection pool utilization, and API request rates. Log aggregation collects logs from all system components into a centralized location where they can be searched and analyzed to diagnose issues.

## Target Capacity & Performance Requirements

The initial deployment of TIES Together is designed to support approximately 250 concurrent users, which translates to a total user base of several thousand registered users depending on usage patterns. This capacity target informs infrastructure sizing decisions, testing requirements, and architectural choices to ensure the platform delivers a responsive, reliable experience under expected load.

### Performance Benchmarks

The platform is designed to meet specific performance targets that ensure a smooth user experience. Page load times should remain under two seconds for initial page loads on broadband connections and under one second for subsequent navigations benefiting from cached assets. API response times should average under 200 milliseconds for most requests and remain under one second even for complex searches or reports. Database queries should execute in under 100 milliseconds for typical operations and use appropriate indexes to prevent table scans on large datasets. File uploads should support resumable uploading for large media files and provide real-time progress feedback to users.

Real-time messaging should deliver messages with latency under one second between sender and recipient under normal network conditions. Map interactions should remain fluid with smooth panning and zooming even when displaying hundreds of venue markers through clustering. Search results should update in real-time as users adjust filters without noticeable lag. These performance targets are validated through load testing before launch and monitored continuously in production to detect degradation.

### Scalability Architecture

While the initial deployment targets 250 concurrent users, the platform's architecture supports scaling well beyond this capacity as the user base grows. The stateless API design allows adding more backend servers behind a load balancer to distribute request load horizontally. Database read operations can be distributed across read replicas to handle increased query volume. File storage through Supabase and Cloudinary scales automatically with usage. The React frontend served through CDN supports millions of concurrent users without additional infrastructure changes.

Supabase's managed infrastructure handles connection pooling and query optimization automatically. As database size grows, additional indexes and query optimizations may be needed, but the relational database structure supports efficient querying at scale. If database performance becomes a bottleneck at very high scale, sharding strategies can distribute data across multiple database instances based on user geography or other logical divisions.

The payment infrastructure through Stripe Connect scales automatically with transaction volume with no platform-level changes required. Stripe's infrastructure handles thousands of transactions per second for major e-commerce platforms, providing ample headroom for TIES Together's growth. The platform's commission-based revenue model means that increased transaction volume directly funds any necessary infrastructure scaling.
