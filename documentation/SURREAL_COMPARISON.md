---

## TIES TOGETHER - UNIQUE DIFFERENTIATORS

### What Makes TIES Together DIFFERENT & BETTER:

#### 1. BROADER SCOPE
**Surreal:** Entertainment booking ONLY (musicians, DJs, bands)
**TIES:** Complete creative marketplace (photographers, videographers, venues, vendors, catering, equipment, performers)

**Impact:** TIES serves a much wider market - ANY creative event, not just live music

---

#### 2. TWO BOOKING WORKFLOWS

**Surreal:** Single workflow - Agency/Venue books Entertainer
**TIES:**
- **Workflow 1:** Direct booking (simple, one-on-one)
- **Workflow 2:** Job posting with multiple roles (Upwork-style)

**Impact:** TIES handles complex events with multiple vendors/roles better

---

#### 3. JOB POSTING SYSTEM (Workflow 2)

**Surreal:** Doesn't have this
**TIES:** Organisers post jobs with multiple roles, receive applications, select candidates

**Example Event:**
```
Wedding - 150 Guests
- Role 1: DJ ($500 budget) → 8 applicants
- Role 2: Photographer ($800 budget) → 12 applicants
- Role 3: Venue ($2,000 budget) → 5 applicants
- Role 4: Caterer ($3,000 budget) → 6 applicants
```

Organiser reviews applicants per role, selects best fit, system auto-creates bookings.

**Impact:** This is HUGE - Surreal can't do complex multi-role events like this

---

#### 4. WORKSPACE COLLABORATION (Phase 5B)

**Surreal:** Basic chat and worksheets
**TIES:** Full project workspace per job with:
- **Task management** - Assign tasks to team members
- **File sharing** - Upload contracts, documents, assets
- **Team messaging** - Thread-based conversations
- **Expense tracking** - Track costs against budget

**Impact:** TIES handles the entire event lifecycle, not just booking

---

#### 5. VENDOR SUPPORT

**Surreal:** No vendor category
**TIES:** Dedicated Vendor role (catering, equipment rental, services)

**Impact:** TIES is a true "one-stop shop" for ALL event needs

---

#### 6. VENUE SEARCH & BOOKING

**Surreal:** Venues are customers (they book entertainers), not service providers
**TIES:** Venues can be booked as event spaces with:
- Map-based venue search (Mapbox integration)
- Venue profiles with capacity, amenities
- Venue booking like any other service

**Impact:** TIES handles venue sourcing, Surreal doesn't
