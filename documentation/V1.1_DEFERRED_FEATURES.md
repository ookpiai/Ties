## 💳 PAYMENT PROCESSING (Phase 4B - DEFERRED)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: P0 Priority

**Status:** 🔴 Deferred to v1.1
**Estimated Time:**
- Option 1 (Simple Auto-Payout): 3-4 hours
- Option 2 (True Escrow): 2-3 days

**Decision Made:** November 10, 2025
**Decision By:** User + Claude Code
**Reason:** Focus on completing core workflows (discovery, booking, jobs, messaging) before adding payment complexity. Test platform with real users first, then add payments.

---

### Option 1: Simple Auto-Payout (3-4 hours) - RECOMMENDED FOR v1.1

**Description:**
- Client pays when booking → Funds held → Booking completes → Auto-payout to freelancer
- No client approval required
- No dispute resolution system
- Standard marketplace flow

**When to Implement:**
- After v1.0 launches and you have 10+ active users
- When ready to handle real money transactions
- After Stripe Connect approved

**Prerequisites:**

- Includes dispute resolution, evidence uploads, admin dashboard
- 7-day auto-approval timeout
- Full dispute management system

**When to Implement:**
- After v1.1 launched with Option 1 (simple payments)

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Option 1 (Simple Auto-Payout) working in production
- ✅ User feedback indicating need for escrow
- ⚠️ Admin dashboard infrastructure ready
- ⚠️ Evidence upload system ready (files, images)

  booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id),
  initiated_by TEXT,
  reason TEXT,
  client_evidence JSONB,
  freelancer_evidence JSONB,
  resolution TEXT,
  status TEXT,
  resolved_by UUID,
  resolved_at TIMESTAMPTZ,

## 📧 EMAIL CONFIRMATION FLOW (Phase 6 - DEFERRED)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: P0 Priority

**Status:** 🔴 Deferred to v1.1
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Decision Made:** November 10, 2025
**Reason:** Polish item, not blocking core functionality. Users can still sign up and use platform without this.

**Current Behavior:**
- User signs up → Confirmation email sent → User must manually navigate to app and log in
- Profile data not persisted from signup form to confirmation

**Desired Behavior:**
- User signs up → "Check your email" screen appears → User clicks link in email → Auto-logged in + profile data from signup
- Seamless flow like all modern web apps

**Implementation Checklist:**

- [ ] Create "Check Email" screen component:
  - [ ] Show after signup submission
  - [ ] Display: "We've sent a confirmation link to [email]"
  - [ ] "Didn't receive it? Resend" button
  - [ ] "Need to change email?" link back to signup

- [ ] Configure Supabase Auth email confirmation:
  - [ ] Update email template with branded design
  - [ ] Set confirmation link redirect URL
  - [ ] Enable auto-login after confirmation

  - [ ] Detect confirmation redirect
  - [ ] Auto-create profile with stored data
  - [ ] Clear localStorage after profile created

- [ ] Update signup flow in `Login.jsx`:
  - [ ] Show "Check Email" screen after signup
  - [ ] Don't immediately redirect to app
  - [ ] Handle resend confirmation email

- [ ] Handle confirmation callback:
  - [ ] Detect confirmation success
  - [ ] Retrieve stored signup data
  - [ ] Create profile automatically
  - [ ] Redirect to dashboard
  - [ ] Show success toast: "Welcome! Your account is confirmed."

- [ ] Test full flow:
  - [ ] Signup with email/password
  - [ ] See "Check Email" screen
  - [ ] Receive confirmation email
  - [ ] Click link
  - [ ] Auto-logged in with profile data
  - [ ] Test with Google OAuth (skip confirmation)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Add confirmation handling
- `src/components/auth/Login.jsx` - Add "Check Email" screen
- `src/App.jsx` - Handle confirmation redirect
- Supabase Dashboard - Update email template

**Priority:** 🔴 P0 - Do this early in v1.1, significantly improves user experience

## 📧 SENDGRID EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS (Phase 6 - DEFERRED)

### Priority: 🟡 P1

**Status:** 🟡 Deferred to v1.1
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
**Decision Made:** November 10, 2025
**Reason:** Platform works without email notifications. Users can check app for updates. Nice-to-have but not critical for v1.0.

**Current Behavior:**
- No email notifications sent for booking events
- Users must check app for updates

**Desired Behavior:**
- Email sent for all major events (booking request, acceptance, completion, etc.)

## 📊 DASHBOARD STATISTICS (Phase 6 - DEFERRED)

### Priority: 🟢 P2

**Status:** 🟢 Deferred to v1.1
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Decision Made:** November 10, 2025
**Reason:** Visual polish, dashboard exists but shows placeholder data. Not critical for v1.0.

**Current Behavior:**
- Dashboard shows static/placeholder statistics
- No real data integration

**Desired Behavior:**
- Dashboard shows real-time statistics:
  - Total bookings (as client and freelancer)
  - Upcoming bookings count
  - Pending requests count
  - Revenue earned (freelancer) - after payments implemented
  - Total spent (client) - after payments implemented
  - Jobs posted (organiser)
  - Applications sent (freelancer)
  - Response rate
  - Average rating (future feature)

**Implementation Checklist:**

- [ ] Create database function: `get_user_dashboard_stats(user_id)`
  - [ ] Count total bookings as client
  - [ ] Count total bookings as freelancer
  - [ ] Count upcoming bookings (start_date > now)
  - [ ] Count pending requests
  - [ ] Sum revenue (if payments implemented)
  - [ ] Count jobs posted (Phase 5)
  - [ ] Count applications sent (Phase 5)
  - [ ] Calculate response rate

- [ ] Update Dashboard.jsx:
  - [ ] Fetch real stats via API
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded values
  - [ ] Add loading states
  - [ ] Add error handling
  - [ ] Refresh on mount

- [ ] Add stat cards for:
  - [ ] "Upcoming Bookings" with count badge
  - [ ] "Pending Requests" (highlight if > 0)
  - [ ] "Total Earnings" (if freelancer + payments enabled)
  - [ ] "Active Jobs" (if organiser)

- [ ] Test with multiple user roles:
  - [ ] Freelancer dashboard
  - [ ] Client dashboard
  - [ ] Organiser dashboard
  - [ ] Venue dashboard

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`
- `src/api/stats.ts` (NEW - create this)
- Database: Create `get_user_dashboard_stats()` function

**Priority:** 🟢 P2 - Nice visual improvement but not functional

---

## ⚠️ RATE REQUIREMENT ENFORCEMENT (Phase 6 - DEFERRED)

### Priority: 🟡 P1

**Status:** 🟡 Deferred to v1.1
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Decision Made:** November 10, 2025
**Reason:** UX improvement, not blocking. Freelancers can still set rates, just not enforced.

**Current Behavior:**
- Hourly/daily rate fields optional in profile settings
- Users can skip filling rates
- Causes confusion in booking flow (no rate shown)

**Desired Behavior:**
- Require at least one rate (hourly OR daily) for freelancers
- Show validation error if neither filled
- Prevent profile save until at least one rate set
- Guide users to fill rates on first login

**Implementation Checklist:**

- [ ] Update ProfilePage.jsx:
  - [ ] Add validation: require hourly_rate OR daily_rate
  - [ ] Show error if both empty: "Please set at least one rate"
  - [ ] Highlight rate fields on validation error

- [ ] Add onboarding prompt:
  - [ ] Show modal on first login: "Set your rates"
  - [ ] Explain importance of rates for bookings
  - [ ] Allow skip but show warning
  - [ ] Store "rates_set" flag in profiles table

- [ ] Update public profile view:
  - [ ] Show "Rate not set" if no rates
  - [ ] Hide "Book Now" button if no rates
  - [ ] Show tooltip: "This professional hasn't set rates yet"

- [ ] Test enforcement:
  - [ ] Try to save profile without rates (should fail)
  - [ ] Set hourly rate only (should work)
  - [ ] Set daily rate only (should work)
  - [ ] Set both rates (should work)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/profile/ProfilePage.jsx`
- `src/components/profile/PublicProfileView.jsx`
- `src/components/onboarding/RateSetupModal.jsx` (NEW - optional)

**Priority:** 🟡 P1 - Improves UX significantly

---

## 🎨 TOAST NOTIFICATIONS (Phase 6 - DEFERRED)

### Priority: 🟢 P2

**Status:** 🟢 Deferred to v1.1
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours
**Decision Made:** November 10, 2025
**Reason:** Currently using browser `alert()`. Works but not pretty. Nice-to-have polish.

**Current Behavior:**
- Success/error messages shown via `alert()` or `console.log()`
- Not consistent across app
- Poor UX (blocking alerts)

**Desired Behavior:**
- Toast notifications (non-blocking, auto-dismiss)
- Consistent design across app
- Success (green), Error (red), Info (blue), Warning (yellow)
- Stack multiple toasts
- Dismiss on click or after 3-5 seconds

**Implementation Checklist:**

- [ ] Install toast library:
  ```bash
  npm install react-hot-toast
  # OR
  npm install sonner
  ```

- [ ] Create ToastProvider:
  - [ ] Wrap app in provider
  - [ ] Configure default settings (position, duration)
  - [ ] Customize styling to match brand

- [ ] Replace all `alert()` calls with toasts:
  - [ ] Search codebase for `alert(`
  - [ ] Replace with `toast.success()` or `toast.error()`
  - [ ] Auth flows (login, signup, logout)
  - [ ] Profile updates
  - [ ] Booking actions
  - [ ] Job applications
  - [ ] Messages

- [ ] Create toast helper utility:
  ```typescript
  // src/utils/toast.ts
  export const showSuccess = (message: string) => toast.success(message)
  export const showError = (message: string) => toast.error(message)
  export const showInfo = (message: string) => toast.info(message)
  ```

- [ ] Test toast stacking:
  - [ ] Trigger multiple toasts quickly
  - [ ] Verify they stack nicely
  - [ ] Verify auto-dismiss works
  - [ ] Test on mobile

**Recommended Library:** `sonner` (modern, lightweight, great UX)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main.jsx` - Add ToastProvider
- All components using `alert()` - Replace with toast
- `src/utils/toast.ts` (NEW - create helper)

**Priority:** 🟢 P2 - Nice polish but not critical
