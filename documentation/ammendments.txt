Iteration 1 Amendments

•	In the Discovery Page under ‘More filters’ section add an Availability section. This will be used to sort out available and unavailable users for the client. 
•	The Discover Talent section can remove the follow main filters at the top: Collectives, Organisers.

•	Under the subscription parts add a ‘Compare Editions’ visual which will highlight the differences between each edition highlighting the benefits. This visual will be used as a Table and will include ticks to various features and crosses for the editions that do not possess the features. 

•	This section currently lives inside the settings page under “Billing and Subscription”. 
•	Studio Pro Subscription needs to be deleted.
 
•	The ‘Jobs Listing’ section within Studio needs to be removed 
•	Instead if users need to create a workspace for a job they currently have they can do so with the TIES Pro Subscription otherwise they are limited to the Jobs board and messages to communicate. 
 
•	The ‘My Job Applications’ & ‘My Job Postings’ sections currently located under ‘More’ need to be inside the ‘Jobs Page’. The Jobs page should then have three individual sections, the first being the Jobs Board that we currently have, two ‘My Job Applications’ which will be renamed ‘My Applications’, three ‘My Job Postings’ which will be renamed ‘My Listings’.


•	The profile page needs to be universal and can apply to any user depending on what VFV (Venue, Freelancers or Vendor) the user is. Currently the top grey bar has a ‘Overview, Settings, then Availability layout’. Change this layout to ‘Overview, Portfolio, Services, Availability’. I have kept the first two sections and the last the same as they are universal, I have added services as a universal blanket term.
•	Inside services you’ll see the following which it will then change depending on what user you’ve signed up as:
